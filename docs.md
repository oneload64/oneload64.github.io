title: OneLoad64 Collection Setup
--- 

### Basics

The OneLoad64 Collection re-works games so they can be loaded on Commodore 64 emulators, FPGA implementations and real hardware (using a Flash Cart) — without needing to know anything about BASIC or how the C64 works. Just load the `.CRT` files directly, and the game will start automatically.

### Requirements

Many Commodore 64 games assume you have a keyboard available to start the game — often requiring you to hit `F1` or similar to start. So if you are using a handheld or FPGA device, make sure you know how to bring up the virtual keyboard, or attach a keyboard via USB or Bluetooth. If you only have a gamepad/joystick, it will be hard to start many of the games.
